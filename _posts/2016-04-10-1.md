#Hey, I'm Bek

It's taken my boyfriend (now fiance) somewhere between one and two years to build me a blog. right?!

Well in that time, boy have I got some stories for you. _Hopefully some lessons too_.

But none of that now. Here's a quick run down of why I'm here, what makes me tick, and who you might be as a befriended reader!

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

I try and do all the stuff. Life is short and I want to cram living down its stupid face!

None of this living by cultural norms. I do the things that excite me, please me, teach me, lead me...
