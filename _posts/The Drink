You know, some days you just really need a fucking drink. Because your toddler has been on one all day, like he found a secret stash of cocaine and is going ‘*mad for it*’ while binge watching Peppa Pig.

Like he has a secret vendetta to *end your life* but will make it look like an accident. Because he won’t stop hitting you and telling you that “you, mummy, are totes in the wrong for trying to feed me. You are a terrible human for preparing me this delicious food and I will now smush it all over my clothes and the dining room carpet.”

You know those days?

Today is one of those days. Also, the toddler ain’t really a fan of sleep right now, in any capacity. Nap times are an actual war zone, and don’t even get me started on bedtime.

It’s taking him around 2 hours to settle at night right now. He *WILL* shout in his cot untill you come upstairs and do…well…nothing. He just wants you to come upstairs.

And nap time? Well, nap time is kind of a bust but I am nowhere near ready to be giving that one up yet. He still needs naps, I’m damn sure of it.

We are house/cat sitting for some friends and as the toddler is at nursery 3 mornings a week so the fiancee and I are taking it in shifts. It’s currently his turn to look after the house.

For him this means days of doing whatever the fuck he wants, going into Manchester town, working in coffee shops and schmoozing with the childless people.

*_For me?_* It’s keeping the toddler alive as I try to keep some modecum of sanity and regularity with my work schedule.

We will soon be reunited as a family unit and I will be palming the toddler off onto the fiancee for a few hours to at least have a bath in peace, or whatever you do without a toddler draped on your person.

But for now, I drink.
