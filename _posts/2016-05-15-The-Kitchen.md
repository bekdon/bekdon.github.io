title: The Kitchen

The aim of this project is to write some amount of words every day and post it on ‘The Blog’.

(Information you don’t *really* need to know, but might like to know: I am having a life crisis. One of those things where you go, wait, SHIT, I have no fucking idea what I’m doing with myself. What does it all mean? Who am I? And does anybody care?)

So, that’s what I’ve got going on right now.

What’s the kitchen got to do with it?

Err, well, *nothing* really.

The toddler just got himself a brand new kitchen. And by got himself I mean the fiancee purchased him a kitchen via Ebay. The toddler was extremely happy about this and has spent the last 3 days making odd concoctions and forcing us all to ‘eat’ them.

Super cute, until you’re forced to ‘eat’ a piece of plastic toast the dog just had it’s mouth around.

His dad (the fiancee) loves to cook, which is great for me cause I’m not a fan. I mean I will if I have to and I love eating *all the food*, but I’m not a fan of preparing it. So I’m hoping this means I’ll have two fellas in my life to feed me **forever**.

The toddler even has a Dennis the Menace apron that he insists on wearing and he’ll go apeshit if the dogs come near his stuff. It’s great. It’s his domain, he knows what he wants and he *will* cut you if you mess with it.

Having an independent and (very) assertive toddler can be tough at times, like when he shouts ‘No mummy! Stop it!’ and smacks your phone out your hand in the middle of the supermarket. But it’s great seeing his assertiveness being put to good use, like in the kitchen as he makes me food.

This I will **_always_** encourage.
